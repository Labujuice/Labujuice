<!---
        - Demand Verification and Validation: Rigorously verify the source of requirements and ensure their rationality and feasibility, avoiding resource wastage due to inappropriate demands.
        - Requirement Decomposition and Specification: Utilize topological analysis methods to break down user needs into actionable specifications, concurrently producing clear requirement descriptions and test items.
        - Rapid Feasibility Assessment: Quickly evaluate technical feasibility at both the software and hardware levels based on theoretical foundations and team experience, providing a basis for project decisions.
        - Project Process Management (Waterfall+V-model): Employ a project management system to manage projects using a Waterfall combined with a V-model approach, ensuring that stakeholders (requesters, developers, and testers) collaborate under a unified information standard.
        - Technical Goal Setting and Tracking: Define clear technical goals, ensuring the team accurately understands and follows them, and monitor execution progress through established checkpoints to prevent deviation from the direction.
        - Cross-Organizational and Cross-Functional Communication and Coordination: Facilitate effective communication among stakeholders from different organizations and technical domains (mechanical, electrical, software/firmware), enhancing the collaborative efficiency of technical development and project execution.

        - 需求查證與驗證： 嚴謹核實需求來源，確保其合理性與可行性，避免因不當需求導致的資源浪費。
        - 需求展開與規格化： 運用拓樸分析方法，將使用者需求細化為可執行之規格，並同步產出清晰的需求描述與測試項目。
        - 快速可行性評估： 結合理論基礎與團隊經驗，迅速評估軟硬體層面的技術可行性，為專案決策提供依據。
        - 專案流程管理 (Waterfall+V-model)： 運用專案管理系統，以 Waterfall 結合 V-model 的方式管理專案，確保需求方、開發方及驗證方在統一的資訊標準下協同作業。
        - 技術目標設定與追蹤： 制定明確的技術目標，確保團隊準確理解並遵循，並透過設定查核點監控執行進度，避免偏離方向。
        - 跨組織與跨領域溝通協調： 促進不同組織與技術領域（機構、電子、軟韌體）的利害關係人進行有效溝通，提升技術開發與專案執行的協同效率。
